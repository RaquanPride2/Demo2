  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
  <h2>Bio</h2>


  <p>My name is Raquan Pride Jr, I am a 3rd-year Computer Science Major at Niagara University. I choose to study Computer Science because technology has always been something I enjoyed interacting with my entire life. It is clear that technology is the future and I want to help build that future. My ultimate goal is to gain enough knowledge and experience. Outside of school, I enjoy playing sports, reading, traveling, and spending time with my family. </p>
  
  <p> The webiste you are seeing was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Everything you see here is the product of my Web Design class. Full disclosure I took said class almost 2 years ago now so forgive meif there are any issues. If you have any questions, contact me at my <a href="mailto:rpride@mail.niagara.edu" style="text-decoration: underline;">email address</a>
